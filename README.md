### Final Exam - Julia Selma

Please run using the chromeTests.xml file.

If a test doesn´t pass please re-run the specific test (because they eventually do).

Sometimes it has waiting issues (specially when it is waiting for the second flight results) that I couldn´t fix because it is not behaving every time the same way.

Firefox is running with a bug (it skips the first letter when keys are sent to search for a city), so it brings no results. I still can´t find the solution. Many people had this same problem running with chrome and it turned out to be a bug with the webdriver. I couldn´t find the way to make it run. I will continue working on this!.
